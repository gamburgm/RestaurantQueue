GOAL:

1) To become more familiar with linked lists
2) To use multithreading

Yeah, I guess that's it.

What should these classes look like?

Restaurant Queue?

Alright, here are the rules:

Three threads:
1) The Line Manager: Takes user input and adds generated people to the line
2) The Restaurant Manager: Adds people from the line, who spend a certain amount of time at the specified venue and then leave. Time spent is based on individual characteristics and venue visited.
3) The Record Manager: Records information on who joins the line, who enters the restaurant, and who leaves the restaurant

Classes:
1) The Restaurant/Venue: Can have multiple types? Maybe a mall or something? Unclear. 
2) The Queue: The line into the restaurant. The Restaurant has an instance of a Queue, a pointer shared between it and the threads that need to maintain or observe the line.
3) Party: A unit in the queue to the restaurant. Can be composed of multiple people and related things.
